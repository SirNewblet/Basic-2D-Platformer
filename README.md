## 🕹️ About the Game

Mr. Squiggles is no ordinary 64x64 pixel protagonist. He's sad...because that's how I drew the sprite initially and decided to keep it that way. He is traversing through a Halloween world, fighting monsters uglier than himself, evading highly dangerous traps, and collecting little trinkets along the way.
